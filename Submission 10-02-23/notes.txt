1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   This point of this project was to model and analyze percolation systems. We completed the code of certain classes that implemented the interface Percolation to
   simulate percolation systems and provided methods that determine wether a given system/model will Percolate. We also provided methods to determine which and how many sites
   are open in a given system.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   I did not receive any help from a person, rather I spent a significant amount of time on forums, lecture material and improving my mastery of the java language.

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I found the project and assignment to be quite challenging. That is not to say I did not enjoy completing them, on the contrary, I
   really enjoyed it. However, I really struggled with importing the libraries I needed to verify the output of my code, I ran into many different
   compilation errors and at the start I really struggled to understand what I had to do. Through these tasks, I significantly enforce my understanding
   of java and basic data structures. I look forward to learning more and being challenged more.
